A workspace that can be fully customized with [Layout-](/ui-components/floating-tiles/layout) and [Hise Floating Tiles](/ui-components/floating-tiles/hise).

Activate the [Layout Mode](/working-with-hise/menu-reference/view#enable-layout-mode) to add new interface separations. When you lock the Layout Mode again, you can add new Hise Floating Tiles with a **right-click** on an empty tile.
